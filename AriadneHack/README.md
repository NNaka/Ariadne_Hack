IDHack 2015 Project

Taken from the Ariadne Labs project description:

Tracking neonatal and maternal mortality in resource limited settings (Ariadne Labs)
Hundreds of thousands of babies and mothers are dying in the developing world of completely preventable deaths. We have a solution! But we need your help scaling it. Join the Harvard School of Public Health, the Gates Foundation, and the Indian government by figuring out how to get moms in India to let us know that they’re pregnant, where their babies are born, and how they’re doing. While you’ve got their attention, offer them important advice or services to increase the odds of a healthy child entering the world. Hack well and your idea will be deployed across Uttar Pradesh India.
